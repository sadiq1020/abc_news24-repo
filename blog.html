                                    <h5>Var</h5>
                                    Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled.There are issues associated with
                                    variables declared with var, though. Var declarations are globally scoped or
                                    function/locally scoped. <br>
                                    Var variables can be re-declared and updated. And also var variables are hoisted to
                                    the top of their scope. <br><br>
                                    <h5>Let</h5>
                                    let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an
                                    improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just
                                    covered. <br>
                                    A variable declared in a block with let is only available for use within that block.
                                    Let can be updated but not re-declared. When using let, you don't have to bother if
                                    you have used a name for a variable before as a variable exists only within its
                                    scope. <br>
                                    Just like var, let declarations are hoisted to the top. Unlike var which is
                                    initialized as undefined, the let keyword is not initialized. So if you try to use a
                                    let variable before declaration, you'll get a Reference Error. <br><br>
                                    <h5>Const</h5>
                                    Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share
                                    some similarities with let declarations. <br>
                                    Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they
                                    were declared. <br>
                                    The value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It
                                    cannot be updated or re-declared. Every const declaration, therefore, must be
                                    initialized at the time of declaration. <br>
                                    Just like let, const declarations are hoisted to the top but are not initialized.

                                    An arrow function is also known as the fat arrow function. It is a new feature
                                    introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions.
                                    Both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner but
                                    there are some differences between them. <br> <br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Syntax:</strong>A programmer can get the same result as regular
                                            functions by writing a few lines of code using arrow functions.
                                            Curly brackets are not required if only one expression is present.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Arguments binding:</strong>arguments object inside the regular
                                            functions contains the list of arguments. The arrow function, on the
                                            opposite, doesn't define arguments i.e. they do not have arguments binding.
                                            But you can easily access the arrow function arguments using a rest
                                            parameter.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Use of this keyword:</strong>Inside of a regular JavaScript
                                            function,
                                            this value is dynamic. The dynamic context means that the value of this
                                            depends on how the function is invoked. The behavior of this inside of an
                                            arrow, function differs considerably from the regular function's this
                                            behavior as an arrow function does not have its own “this” keyword. <br>
                                            The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the
                                            lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the
                                            closest non-arrow parent function which means No matter how or where being
                                            executed, this value inside of an arrow function always equals this value
                                            from the outer function.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Using a new keyword:</strong>Regular functions are constructible and
                                            callable. They can be called using the new keyword. <br>But, the arrow
                                            functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e., arrow functions can
                                            never be used as constructor functions.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h5>Template Strings in JavaScript</h5>
                                    Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It
                                    lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to
                                    concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings
                                    that are complex and contain dynamic elements. <br>
                                    Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags. Tags are functions
                                    that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are
                                    great for converting strings to different entities. <br>
                                    Another great feature of template strings is that we can have strings with multiple
                                    lines for better code readability. <br>
                                    Template strings can be nested in each other. This is a great feature because many
                                    people want to create dynamic strings. <br>
                                    With template strings, we can add something called tags in front of a template
                                    string. They are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string
                                    as parameters. <br>
                                    Template strings have a special raw property that you can get from tags. The raw
                                    property gets us the string without escaping the special characters, hence the
                                    property is called raw.
